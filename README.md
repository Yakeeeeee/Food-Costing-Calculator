## Data Storage

### Ingredients CSV
- **Headers**: Ingredient Name, Price, Grams, Price per Gram, Grams Needed in Recipe, Cost per Recipe
- **Auto-creation**: File created automatically on first run
- **Calculations**: Price per gram and cost per recipe calculated automatically

### Recipes CSV

- **Auto-creation**: File created automatically on first run
- **Cost Structure**: Includes labor and overhead calculations

## Cost Calculation Formula

The application uses a comprehensive cost calculation system:

1. **Total Ingredient Cost** = Sum of all ingredient costs for the recipe
2. **Miscellaneous Cost** = 50% of Total Ingredient Cost
3. **Labor Cost** = 45% of Total Ingredient Cost
4. **Total Cost** = Total Ingredient Cost + Miscellaneous Cost + Labor Cost
5. **Suggested Selling Price** = Total Cost √ó (1 + Margin%/100)
   - The Calculator exposes a "Target Margin (%)" field. Default is 150 (which results in a 2.5√ó multiplier).
6. **Profit** = Suggested Selling Price - Total Cost

## Customization

### Colors
The application uses a consistent color scheme:
- **Background**: #1e1e1e (dark)
- **Cards**: #2d2d2d (medium dark)
- **Accent**: #4cafef (blue)
- **Success**: #28a745 (green)
- **Warning**: #ff9500 (orange)
- **Error**: #ff6b6b (red)

### Window Size
Default window size is 1400x900 pixels, but the application is responsive and adapts to different sizes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **CSV Errors**: Check file permissions and ensure CSV files aren't open in other applications
3. **UI Issues**: Try resizing the window or restarting the application
4. **Calculation Errors**: Verify that all numeric inputs are valid numbers

### Performance
- Large datasets may slow down the ingredients and recipes screens
- Consider archiving old data for better performance

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Recipe templates and categories
- Cost history tracking
- Multiple currency support
- Recipe scaling (different batch sizes)
- Ingredient inventory management
- Backup and restore features
